"""
TVM FFI Bindings Template for C++ Kernels.

This file provides Python bindings for your C++ kernel using TVM FFI.
The entry point function name should match the `entry_point` setting in config.toml.

Getting started:
  1. Read the `reference` field in docs/definition.json to understand the computation semantics
  2. Read docs/definition.json for input/output shapes and dtypes
  3. Implement the kernel logic in kernel.cpp
  4. Update this file to call your C++ implementation
  5. Run: bash scripts/bench.sh
