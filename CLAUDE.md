# kernel-opt-agent — Session 1 Action Guide

You are operating in the **template repository**. Your job is to gather information from the user, analyze their kernel and benchmark script, and create an isolated child environment for optimization.

## Conversation Protocol

### 1. Gather inputs

Ask the user for:
- **(a) Kernel path** — file or directory containing the kernel to optimize
- **(b) Bench script path** — the script that benchmarks the kernel
- **(c) Hints** (optional) — a file with optimization hints, or verbal hints to include

If the user provides all three upfront, skip asking.

### 2. Analyze the kernel

Read the kernel file(s). Identify:
- **Language**: Python, Triton, CUDA, C++, TileLang, or other
- **Entry point**: the main function name and file
- **Inputs/outputs**: tensor shapes, dtypes, arguments
- **Functionality**: what the kernel computes (one sentence)

Additionally, look for optimization-relevant details to include in the child CLAUDE.md:

- **Reference implementation pitfalls**: Patterns in the reference code that exist for
  simplicity but should NOT be replicated in an optimized version (e.g., full-tensor
  casts/copies that should be done on-the-fly, sequential loops that should be parallel).
  Call these out explicitly so Session 2 avoids copying them.
- **Computation pattern**: Is there reduction, scan, gather/scatter, matmul, elementwise?
  Briefly describe the algorithmic structure.
- **Special semantics**: Padding/sentinel values (e.g., -1 means invalid), boundary
  conditions, output values for edge cases (empty input, all-padding). Clarify whether
  sentinel values appear in contiguous blocks or scattered arbitrarily.
- **Output allocation**: Does the function return new tensors, or write into pre-allocated
  buffers? State this clearly in plain language (avoid jargon like "destination_passing_style").

### 3. Analyze the bench script

Read the bench script **and any libraries/configs it imports**. Identify:

**Required**:
- **Invocation**: how to run it (e.g., `python bench.py --kernel kernel.py`)
- **How it references the kernel**: import path, command-line arg, hardcoded path, etc.
- **Output format**: what it prints (latency, speedup, pass/fail, etc.)
- **Environment needs**: conda env, pip deps, special setup

**Investigate if possible** — look into the bench script's source, imported packages,
and config objects. Include whatever you find in the child CLAUDE.md; if something
is not available (e.g., opaque library), note that limitation so Session 2 doesn't
waste time investigating:

- **Correctness checking**: Does it validate output correctness? What tolerance
  (atol/rtol)? Is it strict (1e-6) or loose (1e-2)? This determines how aggressively
  the agent can trade precision for speed.
- **Timing method**: How is kernel time measured? (Python time.time, CUDA events,
  CUPTI tracing, etc.) Is there L2 cache flushing between iterations?
- **Benchmark config**: Number of warmup runs, iterations, trials. How are results
  aggregated (mean, median, min)?
- **Workload parameters**: What varies across test cases (input sizes, shapes, dtypes)?
  Can you extract the actual parameter values and their distribution?
- **Failure diagnostics**: When a test fails, does the output include error messages or
  tracebacks? If not, note this limitation.
- **Reference baseline**: Is speedup measured against a reference implementation or a
  fixed target? What level is the reference (naive Python, optimized CUDA, vendor library)?
- **Infrastructure**: Does the benchmark run locally or remotely? Any known failure modes
  (network, resource contention, image build)?

### 4. Confirm with user

Present findings. Ask the user to confirm or correct:
- Kernel summary (language, entry point, functionality)
- Bench invocation and how paths will be adjusted in the child env
- Anything that couldn't be inferred (optimization goal, GPU, environment name, etc.)
- Optional: a short label for the run directory

### 5. Create child environment

Follow the procedure in [Child Environment Creation](#child-environment-creation) below.

### 5b. Self-check the generated CLAUDE.md

Re-read the child CLAUDE.md and verify:
- Is it self-contained? Can Session 2 work without access to this template repo?
- Did you include all benchmark details found during analysis (tolerance, timing,
  config, workload info)?
- Are there ambiguities that Session 2 would need to guess about?
- If important information was unavailable, did you note the limitation?
- Do the optimization directions (if any) make sense given the benchmark setup?
  (e.g., don't suggest cache-warmth optimizations if L2 is flushed)

### 6. Done

Tell the user:
```
cd <child-dir> && claude
```

## Child Environment Creation

### Naming

Create the child directory as a **sibling** of this repo (i.e., `../<name>`):
- With label: `kernel-opt-agent-run-{label}`
- Without: `kernel-opt-agent-run-{YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS}`

### Directory structure

```
kernel-opt-agent-run-xxx/
├── CLAUDE.md                   # Generated task spec (self-contained)
├── HINTS.md                    # Optimization hints
├── .gitignore
├── solution/                   # Kernel files (editable by agent)
├── bench/                      # Bench script + deps (read-only)
├── scripts/
│   └── bench.sh                # Generated wrapper
└── .claude/
    └── settings.local.json     # Agent permissions
```

### Steps

1. **Create directory tree**: `mkdir -p <child>/{solution,bench,scripts,.claude}`

2. **Copy kernel files to `solution/`**: Copy the kernel file(s) into `solution/`. Preserve filenames. If it's a directory, copy contents.

3. **Copy bench script + local deps to `bench/`**: Copy the bench script and any local files it imports into `bench/`. If the bench script is in a directory with helpers, copy the directory contents.

   **Light adjustments allowed**: When copying the bench script, you may make small,
   targeted modifications to improve Session 2's experience. Mark each change with a
   comment (e.g., `# [kernel-opt-agent] added verbose output`). Acceptable adjustments:
   - Make tolerance values explicit (pass `atol`/`rtol` to config instead of relying on defaults)
   - Add workload parameter printing (e.g., print `num_tokens`, `num_pages` alongside results)
   - Add failure detail printing (error message or failure category when status != PASSED)

   Do NOT change benchmark logic, timing method, correctness checking, or workload definitions.

4. **Adjust bench command for new paths**: Figure out the command to run the bench script from the child root, with paths adjusted:
   - Kernel path becomes `solution/<filename>`
   - Bench script path becomes `bench/<filename>`
   - Example: if original was `python bench.py --kernel my_kernel.py`, becomes `python bench/bench.py --kernel solution/my_kernel.py`
   - Pipe through tee to capture output: `<command> 2>&1 | tee _bench_output.txt`

5. **Generate `scripts/bench.sh`**: Read `templates/bench-wrapper.sh` from this repo, replace `{{BENCH_COMMAND}}` with the adjusted command from step 4, write to `<child>/scripts/bench.sh`, make executable.

6. **Write `.claude/settings.local.json`**: Read `templates/agent/claude.json` from this repo, extract the `permissions` object, write as `<child>/.claude/settings.local.json`.

7. **Copy `.gitignore`**: Copy this repo's `.gitignore` to `<child>/.gitignore`.

8. **Write `HINTS.md`**: If user provided a hints file, copy it. If user gave verbal hints, write them. Otherwise copy `templates/hints.md` from this repo.

9. **Write `CLAUDE.md`**: Generate the child's CLAUDE.md following the [required sections](#child-claudemd-required-sections) below. Use `templates/task.md` as a reference example for format and detail level.

10. **Initialize git**: `cd <child> && git init && git add -A && git commit -m "Initial environment"`

### Child CLAUDE.md Required Sections

The generated CLAUDE.md must be **self-contained** — Session 2 will not read this template repo. Include these sections:

1. **Role** — one line: "You are a GPU kernel optimization expert. Your task is to optimize the kernel in `solution/` for maximum performance."

2. **Hints** — "Read `HINTS.md` before starting for user-provided hints and constraints."

3. **Kernel** — language, entry point, input/output shapes and types, what it computes. Be specific — this is what the agent needs to understand the code.

4. **Benchmark** — how to run (`bash scripts/bench.sh [label]`), output format, what PASSED/FAILED means, what the primary metric is.

5. **Editable files** — "Only modify files in `solution/`. Do NOT modify files in `bench/` or `scripts/`."

6. **Workflow** — use the following template, adapted to the specific kernel and benchmark:

```markdown
## Workflow

1. Run `bash scripts/bench.sh "baseline"` to establish baseline performance
2. Analyze baseline output: note workload count, latency distribution, and any
   patterns (e.g., latency tiers suggesting different input sizes). This informs
   which cases to prioritize.
3. Read and analyze the kernel in `solution/`
4. Identify optimization opportunities and rewrite/optimize the kernel
5. Modify kernel -> `bash scripts/bench.sh "description"` -> analyze results -> iterate
6. If a change causes FAILED:
   a. Read the benchmark output to identify the failure type
   b. For numerical errors: try targeted fixes (e.g., more fp32 accumulation)
   c. For crashes: check shape mismatches, OOM, or compilation issues
   d. If the cause is unclear or unfixable, revert: `git checkout solution/`
7. Check per-workload breakdown to target the weakest cases
8. Stop when no further improvements are found; summarize final results
```

**Note on optimization directions**: If including suggested optimization directions in the Workflow or Hints, only include directions that are actually relevant given the benchmark setup. For example, do not suggest L2 cache optimizations if the benchmark flushes L2, and do not suggest CUDA graph optimizations if kernel launch overhead is not the bottleneck.

### Child CLAUDE.md Conditional Sections

Include these sections **if and only if** the relevant information was found during
analysis. Do not fabricate information. If something was investigated but unavailable,
briefly note the limitation instead.

- **Benchmark Internals** — timing method, L2 cache policy, config parameters, result
  aggregation method, reference baseline level
- **Correctness Tolerance** — atol/rtol values and what they imply for precision tradeoffs
- **Workload Distribution** — actual test case parameters and their distribution
- **Known Limitations** — opaque benchmark library, missing error diagnostics, infrastructure
  failure modes, or other constraints Session 2 should be aware of

## Constraints

- Never modify files outside the child directory.
- The child CLAUDE.md must be self-contained (Session 2 does not read this template repo).
- Always init git in the child.
- Adjust all paths in the bench command so they work from the child root directory.
- If the bench script has complex dependencies (conda env, pip packages, etc.), document the environment setup in the child CLAUDE.md's Benchmark section.
